# fhem-rnn
Support for LSTM-Neuronal Networks to predict actions in smartHome scenarios with fhem.

I suggest using anaconda for testing:
There are a few packages necessary:

```cmd
conda create --name tf_gpu 
activate tf_gpu
conda install tensorflow-gpu
conda install pandas
conda install sqlalchemy
conda install pymysql
```
